# CS418-Introduction to graphics-Machine Problems

Interactive Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic digital imagery in real-time. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering and the current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications.

This repository includes 5 machine problems provided in CS418 Introduction to graphics course in FALL 2019, UIUC. 

## Machine Problem Description
### MP1: Dancing Logo
For MP1, I created a 2-D animation of the majestic and inspiring University of Illinois logo. I also created a short 2-D animation of my own designed logo. 

### MP2-1: Terrain Modeling Part 1
In MP2-1,  I procedurally modeled a piece of terrain, which was a static scene. Terrain generation, a perspective view of scene, the Blinn-Phong reflection model, and an elevation-based colormap for the terrain were implemented in this MP.

### MP2-2: Terrain Modeling Part 2
In MP2-2,  I implemented a simple flight simulator based on the work of MP2-1. My "plane" can fly over the terrain, and I also added the capability of applying fog to the terrain. User can use keyboard to control the plane. 

### MP3: Environment Mapping
In MP3, I wrote an app that loads the Utah teapot from a file and renders it. First, I implemented the skybox and cubemap and orbit. Second, I implemented reader for the teapot and reflective shader and rotation. Third, I implemented phong shader and refractive shader. 

### MP4: A simple Physics Engine 
In MP4, I wrote a simple particle system using WebGL to handle the display. I did something simpler and just rendered a system of bouncing spheres in 3D. I rendered a set of spheres bouncing around an invisible 3D box. When a sphere hits one of the walls in the box, it should reflect in physically realistic manner.
